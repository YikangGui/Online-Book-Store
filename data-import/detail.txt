The question to ask yourself here is; what doesn't this unique 1996 Bell 206 NOT have? It does not have a utility history, it does not have a history of cargo lifting, it does not have a history of ab-initio flight training, it does not have a history of tours, repetitive use or lack of professional maintenance. That is all a message to the next owner that they are buying an aircraft that has been subject to the highest standards of maintenance and use with no budget restrictions. Where is the evidence? Look at my photo of the RH rear fuselage and the lack of "oil canning" That is a testimony to the conservative use of this aircraft.


 It has been in private use prior to the last owner for 5 years and before that it was a one owner aircraft. This is one if not the only, Bell 206III models sporting a unique IFR panel. It has a fully functioning autopilot and that in itself would cost you half the value of the helicopter to install today. If you are looking for a flight training IFR turbine helicopter with substantial component times remaining and one of the straightest and lowest time air frames on the market - you know where to call. The next perfect owner of this ship is a private buyer or a flight training school.  This is a valued helicopter in today's market.

LZ-DBO used to be in the UK and UK G-Registered until it was sold to its present Bulgarian owner who has owned it since March 2008. It was with the previous owner from June 2000.


In Bulgaria it was in a CAMO organisation during the current ownership untill November 2017 when the CAMO was shut down. It was used for some rental, some private use, some spraying and some local sightseeing tours.


To get back in the air again it needs the [new] Spindles AD to be performed and also a 8.33 radio which owner is unable to invest in.

1981 AS350 B rebuild project. 12 years ago this aircraft had the engine and transmission removed for rebuild. Unfortunately the guy who removed it stold it and did not return it. 


So after many years of trying to get it back the aircraft is now for sale without these components. 


So missing is the engine complete and the main transmission and tail rotor gearbox. 


With the aircraft is everything else including the rotor blades and tail rotor and starflex etc. 


Was a immaculate aircraft before this happened to it with two owners from new and only 5800 hrs. Has autopilot and is still immaculate with no corrosion. Would make great rebuild in to a B2. 


Please no stupid questions,it is exactly what it says in the add and is available to view in Belfast Northern Ireland. No documents or otherwise will be sent anywhere,if you want to buy it come and view it and everything is available.

Aerostar 601B owned and maintained by Retired Army Aviator. Attention to Detail is a requirement when flying, so this airplane has been maintained and brought up to safety Standards&hellip;.


We have custody of our Grand children and are raising them.  It takes most of our time and flying this beautiful airplane has taken a back seat.  Even though it is a nearly perfect aircraft, we don&rsquo;t fly it enough to justify owning it. Thinking that we would own it for long time, we put a lot of personal money into it.


It&rsquo;s a great airplane now and I have put $100K of personal money into it to make it a reliable, safe and comfortable airplane to fly.

-----------------

            
Built in 1984, this is the only F2A variant Tornado aircraft in existence. This unique aircraft is a &lsquo;T-bird&rsquo; twin stick variant of the Tornado with full flying controls in both cockpits. The aircraft is decommissioned with weapons systems and radar removed, but otherwise complete. 


Tornado F2A ZD902 was originally attached to 229 OCU at RAF Coningsby in a training role. In 1988 it was converted at St Athan to F2A specification. This upgrade was designed to bring early F2 airframes up to F3 standard whilst retaining the Turbo-Union RB199 103 engines. Bizarrely, ZD902 ended up being the only aircraft to receive the modifications, with most of the remaining F2s eventually becoming spares sources. ZD902 was famously used as a camera chase aircraft in 1985 flying alongside Concorde at MACH 2.


Later in her service career seeing use as a trials aircraft for the Defence Research Agency, ZD902 was named TIARA (Tornado Integrated Avionics Research Aircraft). Taskings included Blue Vixen radar trials for the Sea Harrier FA2, and head-up-display work for the Eurofighter Typhoon. TIARA was one of the last test aircraft to be flown out of Royal Aircraft Establishment Farnborough in 1994, concluding 90 years of military test flying at the historic airfield.


The aircraft flew for the last time on November 30th 2011, over six months after the last operational RAF Tornado F3 squadrons had been stood down making this the longest serving Air Defence Variant (ADV) aircraft. She is indeed &lsquo;&rsquo;LAST OF THE FEW&rdquo; as the decal on the nose undercarriage door suggests.


With the vast majority of Tornados reduced to spares parts and scrapped, ZD902 is the last complete example of the Tornado ADV, with engines fitted and hydraulic and electrical systems installed. TIARA has led a very charmed and pampered life and despite a long service career has only clocked up an incredibly low 935 flying hours.


The aircraft is currently stored in a dismantled state in a heated hangar at a former RAF base in Yorkshire, England. Preserved with regular preventative maintenance being carried out, ZD902 is ready for delivery to her next lucky owner.

With the lowest Air Frame time on the market and straight out of an extensive 5 year/5000 hour inspection this Bell 412SP is the market leader for value and performance. The 412 is a dichotomy of the things we love about Bell Helicopters and everyone enjoys pushing through 120 knots in an air frame that has 85% of the attributes of the legendary Bell 212. This BH412SP is ready to work with a tight low hour air frame that formerly served a government department and is unique with all original factory fitted components. The SP superceeds the 'classic' 412 adding underfloor tanks that alleviate the need to fit the 90 Gallon Aux Fuel opening up the side facing seat compartments for crew equipment. The fast cruise, big payload, huge cabin expanding DART Space Doors gives you a solid head start for that next Initial Attack Fire contract. It is priced sensibly and our mandate is to sell and see it out working. This is an Oceania Aviation owned aircraft which means no dealing with middle men. Let's get straight to business.

 Wipaire Boss Turbo Beaver conversion completed in 2002, less than 500 hours since conversion/rebuild. All fuselage skins and control surfaces reskinned, all high stress points were checked, photos of rebuild available upon request! Extended baggage, Sealand Alaskan Door, Wipline 6100 amphibious Floats, WX Radar, Skywatch, G530W/G430W, always hangered!  


    A word about Wipaire&rsquo;s Boss Beaver Conversion:    


The &ldquo;Boss Beaver&rdquo; has significant greater performance and speed over the MK III Turbo Beaver with unmatched performance, less than 1000 ft water take off at full gross @ 6100 lbs, with a rate of climb greater than 1000 fpm! 


The gross weight has been increased to 6100 lbs, which is 100 lbs larger than MK III gross weight of 6000 lbs. The Boss Beaver also weighs less due to the larger tail and longer cabin in the heavier MK III Beaver. Modernized fuel system relocated from the belly to the redesigned in the thicker skin/reinforced wings, 205 US gallons of useable fuel designed after the Caravan Fuel system, a simple on/off style.  The wings also have a reinforced spar and flow generators improving the aileron authority at lower speeds.

Here we have the ultimate "backcountry" aircraft. Currently, on its original landing gear, this T206H comes with floats, affording you the option of sealed or water and the ability to take off from your home airfield and land at the lake. Installing floats on an existing T206H is considerably expensive and with such low time, this aircraft presents as a sensible and practical option. This aircraft has never seen salt water and presents well for the hours. Oceania Aviation is able to deliver the aircraft on fixed landing gear or floats to any part of the globe and we specialise in solving transportation and logistic issues. There are few options for land/sea aircraft available with the performance and legacy of the T206H and we look forward to helping you get out and fly this aeroplane.
